Summer Internship Project – HTML, CSS, JavaScript
A responsive, interactive web application built during a summer internship to practice core front-end skills and real-world development workflows.

Features
Responsive layout with mobile-first design using semantic HTML and modern CSS, ensuring usability across devices.

Interactive UI behaviors implemented with vanilla JavaScript (forms, validation, dynamic DOM updates).

Clean structure following separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS), accessibility considerations, and web best practices.

Tech Stack
HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+).

Explore pages in /pages, styles in /styles, and scripts in /scripts.

Project Structure
index.html — main entry point.

/styles — global and component stylesheets.

/scripts — modular JS for features and utilities.

/assets — images/icons and static assets.

Usage
Navigate via the header or menu to explore modules/components.

Try interactive elements (forms, filters, modals) to see JS-driven behavior.

Resize the window or use dev tools to test responsive breakpoints.

What I Learned
Structuring small-to-medium front-end projects with a clear README and consistent conventions.
